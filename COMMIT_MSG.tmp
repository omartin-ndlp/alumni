feat: Add missing localization keys and update CI database port

This commit adds new localization keys for the user profile pages
across all supported languages (French, English, Spanish, German,
and Klingon). It also corrects the usage of a localization key in
`src/views/users/profile.ejs`.

The MariaDB service in the CI workflow is now mapped to port 3307
to avoid conflicts with local development databases.
